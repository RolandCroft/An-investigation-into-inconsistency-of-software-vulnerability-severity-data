# An investigation into inconsistency of software vulnerability severity data

Vulnerability severity assessment is a difficult and subjective manual task that relies on expertise, knowledge, and standardized reporting schemes. Consequently, different data sources that perform independent analysis may provide conflicting severity rankings. This can impact vulnerability prioritization and other downstream tasks. This codebase investigates severity ranking inconsistencies over the SV reporting lifecycle.  

We consider the severity assessment of reported software vulnerabilities for the Mozilla Firefox project from 2011-2021. We analyse three data sources: Bugzilla, Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory, and NVD. We investigate three research questions:  
- What is the nature of inconsistency for severity reporting schemes?  
- Which factors influence inconsistent rankings for SV severity assessment during early stages?  
- How does SV severity data source inconsistency affect downstream predictions?  

In summary, our findings observe that SV severity often lacks consideration or is underestimated during initial reporting, and such SVs consequently receive lower prioritization. We identify six potential attributes that are correlated to this misjudgment, and show that inconsistency in severity reporting schemes can severely degrade the performance of downstream severity prediction by up to 77%.
